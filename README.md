# Personal Website

Personal site/portfolio for Anderthonn Batista. This is a static website with English and Portuguese versions, highlighting professional information, skills, and contact channels. It also references Microsoft technologies in the professional profile context.

## Project structure

- `index.html`: main page (English version).
- `pages/index.pt.html`: main page (Portuguese version).
- `styles.css`: global site styles.
- `scripts/`: JavaScript files used by the pages.
- `imagens/`: images and icons used in the layout.

## Run locally

Because this is a static project, you can open the main file directly in your browser:

```bash

# Windows

```

If you prefer, serve it with a simple static server:

```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.
